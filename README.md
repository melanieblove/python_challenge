# Bank Data

For the Financial Analysis of the budget dataset, I created an application that searches and looping through every row of data, one of the key in this code is import the numpy module to do the math and find the desire results. The first goal is find the total of the months from the first column, then the total of the budget and looping through the profits and losses, applying math with the negative and positves numbers.
Also this python scrip analyze the changes over the entire period in profit and losses, calculating the average of those changes.
Finally for the analysis of this data I found the greatest increase and greatest decrease in profits over the entire period.

#### Interpretetion of the results.
I found that in the period of (2010 to 2017) were 86 months, the total of the budget was $22564198, with an negative average of $-8311.11, this mean that the changes in profits were negative and were more losses over the entire period. Theremore in February-2014 was the period with the greatest decrease in Profit with the negative amount of $-1825558. Later on, after two years in August-2016 was the period with the greatest increase in Profits with the amount of $1862002, this mean this budget in two years recovered from the greatest loss and increase the profit $36444, approximately 101,95% more from the lose in 2014.

## Poll Data

For the analysis in the election data set I created a python scrip which allows us to calculate each vote for each candidate.The first goal is find the total of voters, this application searches and looping through every row of datat, importing the numpy module. Then find the unique candidates, after that count the vote for each candidate and and encounter which candidate is the winner and the pertange of this results.

#### Interpretetion of the results.
Saying the following findings are:  369711 people participated on the election, there were 3 candidates to choose (Charles Casper Stockham, Diana DeGette, and Raymon Anthony Doane) 

-85213 people voted for Charles Casper Stockham means a 23.049% of popular vote.
-272892 people voted for Diana DeGette means a 73.812% of popular vote.
-11606 people voted for Raymon Anthony Doane means a 3.139% of popular vote.

Saying that the winner of this election based on the popular vote is  with 272892 votes 
Saying so the Winner of this election is Diana DeGette, with an absolute victory of 272892 votes, being the favorite of the people with a 73.812% support of the population.
